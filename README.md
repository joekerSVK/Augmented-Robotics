# Augmented-Robotics
Hello, I made 2 separate variants of implementation.First is in Wordpress using only Elementor plugin and thesecond one i made with HTML and CSS put some Bootstrap in it,with JavaScript.
In First i just send you that domain name where u can just see final product. and in second one i send you full html and css code, that u can run in for example VSCode in your browser.
So please download that rar folder for running code in your PC. I also add some of screenshot of webpage in PC and Phone.
And second option is that you can check this wordpress webpage: https://template-2.thetechtrendsetters.com/ 
Thank you for your time, I hope everything will be allright.

Kind Regards,

Slivka Roman
